								<h2>Defining the Traits</h2>
								<p>Authoritarianism refers to a “deference to authority, aggression towards outgroups, a rigidly hierarchical view of the world, and resistance to new experience” (Pettigrew 108) and often begins in childhood. Early association with authoritarian values are linked with right-wing ideology as the children become adults. Social dominance orientation, or SDO, “features an individual’s preference for the societal hierarchy of groups and domination over lower-status groups” (Pettigrew 108). Part of why Trump has 
									this much influence on the Republican party is because he knows the keywords he needs to use to appeal to this specific demographic. Relative Deprivation refers to the feeling of being deprived of something that one feels entitled to. In Trump supporters, many supporters believed that “immigrants” were taking jobs that they felt entitled to. This perception is skewed “relative”, since most fail to take into account the natural phasing out of jobs due to automation and instead blame others. Prejudice within 
									Trump supporters isn’t limited to racism but prejudice towards any outgroup. Trump has taken a turn from the “dog whistling” strategy of “somewhat subtle codewords for race and other minorities designed to be heard by racists but not by non-racists” by openly saying racist and prejudiced remarks (Pettigrew 110). His followers loved to hear his blatant remarks as it was they had been too afraid to say due to “political correctness”. Prejudice is interlinked with lack of intergroup contact as “intergroup contact 
									has been shown typically to diminish prejudice by reducing intergroup fear and inducing empathy” (Pettigrew 110). Trump supporters tend to be isolated and never have exposure to different racial groups. This way they are more open to prejudice against outgroups. Tying these five characteristics together, people feel threatened, whether it is fake or real. Trump made fake threats of voter fraud and a declining economy to attract more followers by offering protection from said threats.
