								<h2>A bit on Trump's speech</h2>
								<p>Trump does not filter himself when he gives speeches, and the Republican party is conflicted on whether they should stop him from over talking or simply let him talk and appeal to his primary audience. Trump is impartial about the controversy because he has a target audience in mind and is 
									speaking to them. His blatant remarks have no bounds and have offended members of his own party, “including Ohio Governor John Kasich and Senator John McCain” (Russomano 159). The Republican party wanted to restrict Trump’s speech, but they did not remove their support from him; they wanted 
									him to stop talking while his enemies wanted him to keep talking himself into a hole. Twitter became a platform for Trump to speak openly without supervision in his campaign. His staff tricked him to prevent him from using Twitter and saying self destructive comments. To stop Trump from speaking means 
									“[depriving] the electorate of vital information” as his words show his character (Russomano 162). Trump’s hate speech incites fear and is one of the many reasons his critics want to stop his speech. He uses his hateful words to deflect in debates as well as instill fear of the outgroups in his followers.

								<h2>Defining Trumpsim and its effects</h2>
								<p>Trumpism is a new branch of populism because of “his almost complete disregard for political principles” and through “Trump’s antiestablishment, antiglobalist, and economic nationalist agenda”, this exposes the “fears of ‘white decline’” and how Trump becomes the representative and speaker of 
									Trumpism (Ross and Wilton 66). To further define Trumpism, his ideologies are a mix of right-wing populism and neoliberalism. Trumpism and his success roots from the prominent presence of neoliberalism since the 1980s and the “deeply [ingrained] history of white privilege and a constitution that 
									favours individual rights and freedoms over the needs of society as a whole” (Ross and Wilton 67). He gains support from neoliberals by promising smaller government and removing government from business. Neoliberalism beliefs support Trump’s efforts to erase Obamacare. Trump has repeatedly attacked 
									Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act, which would disproportionately “result in more women and children put at risk of living in impoverished circumstances” (Ross and Wilton 67). Trump’s insistence of scrapping Obamacare comes at the expense of the poor, especially due to the extreme income inequality 
									in the US. This can’t be all attributed to Trump, but his lack of policies to remedy the situation don’t alleviate this wealth gap. Although Trump’s presidency has not addressed 
									the economic disparity between the upper class and lower class, “more people have joined political protests and demonstrations than at any other time in American history” (Ross and Wilton 73). Numerous protests have taken place, including the Women’s March in Washington and the Poor People’s Campaign to 
									address issues such as the increase in medical debt. The increase of protests reflects the changing political ideologies in the country where dissent can lead to change.
